8630662,45391169,f,within a few hours,100%,25,95,"I'm excited to be back in my native town. I grew up in the magical big Apple.  Going to to the Broadway shows, ballet and opera was as much part of my education as was going to the French Lycee. The theatre won my heart and I got to study with its greats Stella Adler and Sanford Meisner. After a weekend trip to Los Angeles, I met my future husband, a prolific film director and we spent the next 20 years enjoying making a family  on our hilltop home and traveling the world with our two children. I was always fascinated by human behavior and dove into studying ontology and transformation for the next 15 years. I ran an  interior designer company where I was very successful making every style home irresistible. Always continuing my development  in ontology, I became a sought after life coach.  All throughout the years, we always spent our best times making memories in the big Apple. After my husbands untimely death in 2011, my daughters and I  chose to come back to the city of lights  to be close to my mother. It was time for reinvention and starting a whole chapter. Finding an apartment in NYC was quite a challenge. The tiniest apartment was more that my LA mortgage in a celebrity enclave. I was determined to find a place that was in a neighborhood that was charming and had a heartbeat.  I wanted to step out of my door and feel inspired and enriched by the local color and people, art, boutiques, health stores and gyms . Being close to transportation was also a priority and I soon discovered that in NYC, rent fluctuates according to what floor your apartment is on and how close you are to the subway. These are two of my priorities as you will see. The apartment is close to all transportation and only one floor up. After zooming all over the city with my agent, I kept being drawn back to the historical east village. Yes the apartments are small, but New Yorkers don't spend time in their apartments, as i discovered. More and more metropolitan cities around the world are designing compact living and this is definitely one of them. About me :I've  dedicated my life to my purpose of studying human beings. Who I am is a commitment that all people live awakened to their purpose with heart and soul fulfilled. I coach people privately in distinguishing their authentic full self expression and discovering their true purpose in action with ease freedom and grace. I also teach classes in the Meisner acting technique. The ultimate access to  authentic self expression, this acting technique changes people's lives by bringing them closer to communicating powerfully and courageously from their truth - their soul. This little oasis is my retreat from all the stimuli of the city and a place where I renu after giving all of myself to making a difference to others.  I chose this little East Village apartment because I wanted to step out of my door and feel my heart sing. I know you'll enjoy it too I will be happy to direct you to all the places you'd like to visit.  I speak French and Russian. Looking forward to meeting you!

762145,3315563,f,within an hour,75%,8,97,"Welcome to this vibrant and always-happening Big Apple! I've travelled a lot, but returning to the diverse, bright and creative community of NYC always feels like home to me. New Yorkers ""get you"" as you are, and that is a most liberating feeling! I am a former ballet/contemporary dancer-turned full-time Yoga Instructor and Ayurvedic Practitioner, and I love my work. (And nowhere is my work more needed than in this hyper-kinetic city!)  I was born in Japan, but grew up in the United States, and spent about 10 of my adult years in India living, studying, and exploring the place. It feels like a second home to me, and there's still so much left to explore!I love to travel and discover cultures, sacred places, and approaches to life. The world is as you see it, and I find it vital to my evolution as a human being to keep expanding the way I think, feel and capture life through travel, reading, and meeting people.  I was recently in Barcelona, Cannes, Florence, Rome for vacation and fell in love with Europe all over again. My next adventure will be to Central and South America. I can't wait! In a similar vein, I love books and films that take you into another culture, or period in time. I just saw Beasts of the Southern Wild, and was blown away by it. It's all shot in 16mm, and just so full of life-affirming messages. I also saw the 13 Assassins, an awesome Japanese samurai film by the uber-prolific director Takashi Miike, and was awed by his brilliance as a film maker. I feel he brought the forgotten samurai culture to life in a most dynamic, engaging way.Books I've read recently include 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami, Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera, and Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follet. Fantastic voyages!Five things I can't live without? Hmmm...off the top of my head, I would say:1) An open mind . Ain't no substitute for that!2) A discipline that liberates your body and mind, like Yoga, Surfing, dancing, whatever works.3) Being close to Nature. This is one of the reasons I love where I live. It's a hop-skip away from Riverside Park, with Hudson River, which I dub 'the NYC Ganges'.4) Creative self-expression. I would feel suffocated otherwise.5) Nurturing, loving relationships.And may I also add cultural stimulation to the list. If you ever feel a lack for inspiration, or starving for sensory/mental/spiritual food, there's always something happening here that will answer your call. Or, just sit in a sidewalk cafe and watch the people go by. You'll never be bored! Speaking of food, I am not a foodie, but the restaurants in NYC rock! You can enjoy the culinary gems of the world on a Metrocard.Look forward to being your host and facilitating your discovery of all that the the city has to offer!","['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'kba']"

As a kid I worked on my family's tobacco farm until I went off to college at UNC Chapel Hill. After college, I worked in sales for several years but never found my groove. I wanted to make a difference, so in June, 2010, I packed my bags and headed to New York to become a teacher. For 4 years I taught Special Education and coached wrestling at a high school in the south Bronx. Teaching wasn't quite the career I was looking for, but after seeing kids come to school hungry on a regular basis, I realized what was - I decided I needed to get back to my roots and start farming again. Only this time, I'm farming in New York City!If you're curious about what it's like to farm in major city or if you just like good food, I invite you to stay with me during your trip to New York. My apartment comes with great food, excellent coffee, and a welcoming atmosphere.

Along with the beachside location, another major reason that I chose my apt is the fact that it has a very large private back patio that is enclosed with tall bamboo; I enjoy gardening and have transformed the patio into a lush tropical garden, planting several types of Palm trees, Aloe and Blooming Aloe, Lavender, Jasmine, Tropical Ferns, countless succulents, cacti, flowers, in addition to a variety of vegetables like arugula, lettuce, squash, different types of peppers, and herbs like rosemary and basil.I am currently in my last year of law school, and although my school is downtown, I have found it easy to avoid the traffic with a little planning and using the GPS App Waze.I love traveling and backpacking, and in the past couple years I've traveled to Paris, London, Amsterdam, Argentina, Berlin, India, Thailand, Laos, Indonesia, Bermuda, Honduras, Haiti, Mexico, Argentina and Malaysia.I'd love to explore Myanmar, Africa, Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia, SpainSome of my other favorite activities are surfing, gardening, cooking, and going to see live music.

Native of Brooklyn, Robert, my husband, will be your on-site resource for your discovery of our borough, as well as Manhattan.Originaire du Québec, on m'a un jour arrachée  ma ville adorée, Montréal, pour me déposer au beau milieu de Brooklyn, métropole  la fois hétéroclite, charmante, trépidante et poétique. En 6 ans, je m'y suis tranquillement enracinée, y ai fondé une famille et rencontré des gens captivants venus de partout au monde, qui sont devenus mes amis, ma vie. Mais je m'ennuierai toujours de mon monde  moi, des Québécois comme de tous les autres francophones. Parce qu'on est bien dans sa langue et qu'on y retrouve ce sentiment familier qui nous réconforte. Voil pourquoi j'ai eu l'idée de vous attirer vers moi, pour vous piquer une petite causette pendant que vous passeriez chez nous, entre deux escapades  Manhattan ou au moins  votre arrivée  Brooklyn. Je serai trop heureuse de vous aider  trouver ce que vous cherchez dans les environs, et comme mon mari est originaire de New York, il connais Manhattan et Brooklyn comme le fond de sa poche!","['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews']"

The days go by and I'm enamored, entranced or romanced by many different passing things, faces & places. Some of my loves have come and gone, but New York City remains a constant. Although I've traveled the world and adored cities like Barcelona, London, Lisbon and Paris; New York stays magnus. I cannot fathom calling another place home. When Jay-Z and Alicia Keys coined the Empire Anthem I thought I'd lose my mind everytime I heard it! I do have a superb singing voice -you know? Yankess all the way baby-and there's no better pizza than ours (hands down). You shouldn't take those things lightly! LOL! I'm really a country girl-what's considered a transplant. I grew up in eastern Long Island where there are farms and cabbage patches. I'd go barefoot in the street, eat peaches, cherries and sweet roasted corn from the farm stands on the way to the Hamptons on luscious summer days. But it was like the Emerald City of OZ- this Great Big Apple. It seduced me...A glittery, magical place to aspire to be in. So I followed the yellow brick road and never looked back. As the classic 70s song says, 'No one opens the door-for a native New Yorker"". That's fine; I'm a big girl and my arms aint broken! Just some NYC harsh/gritty humor. However, on those off chances where a gentleman (URL HIDDEN) makes me smile and shine even brighter. And oh-if a kind sir gives up his subway seat to this lady....I know that even in this concrete jungle chivalry isn't dead. You've gotta love this place! Even when you hate it there's some nook or cranny that unfolds and lures you in.As cold and lonely as it can be; it is intimate, heavenly & warm. Kinda like ""make up"" sex.It is really an enormous part of who I am and I wouldn't trade it for anything. I love its noise, bright lights and madness. Without it the quiet would deafen me. Geez-I sound like a cult member.Cult of NYC! So be it-I'm hooked for life! No chance for rehab. I say ""No,no.no"". No-none at all. ;)","['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba', 'work_email']"

In 1999 with his Masters not yet completed, he was hired by Volatile Media in New York City, where he moved, to create the latin/world and jazz/blues catalogs for the custom compilation CD website, (URL HIDDEN) In 2001 Leonardo left Volatile Media, graduated from Emerson College and returned to music full time.

I'm going to New Orleans in the fall and Sri Lanka next winter - so excited!When I travel, I enjoy interacting with the people I meet much more than sightseeing or attractions.

4453484,2166065,t,within an hour,100%,36,97," I work in the adventure film/TV but I dabble in other creative media like music and photography...Peter Goetz innate love for adventure is palpable. The California native and UC Berkeley alum is a seasoned veteran of documentary adventure television and film, using his vast experiences around the globe to carve out compelling stories about unique subcultures and ordinary people enduring the impossible.Goetz has visited over 65 countries working on such fan favorites as Survivor (13 seasons), Amazing Race, Ultimate Survival Alaska 2, and Expedition Impossible. Hes also stepped into the rare worlds of his subjects with his work on Swamp People, Yukon Men, The Buried Life and Die Trying. With over a decade of adventure programming experience under his belt, Goetz has left few rocks unturned, and without question (or hesitation) hes enjoyed every second of it! For Goetz, each project introduces a greater take-away than the adventure at hand, he feels honored to unveil the raw interactions and emotional connections that organically unfold before him. Goetz takes us on a journey by intimately exposing what is as at its most authentic, a truly uninterrupted social experience.Working in remote, extreme environments, every project offers up its own series of challenges. The best stories are spontaneous and allowing for moments to surface naturally is essential to producing story gold. The single most rewarding element of any adventure project is to experience the thrill of the unknown and witness the transformative payoff of ordinary folks enduring extreme adversity. We are resilient creatures, but we so rarely put ourselves to the test. When we do, its life changing! In addition to being recognized for his distinctive production work, Goetz is an acclaimed photographer and soulful musician. With each new opportunity that his fast-paced career brings, Goetz finds himself enveloped and inspired by his surroundings. He speaks both Spanish and Portuguese, opening up experiences to direct his award winning bilingual documentary film, Sofia, write and record trilingual songs that have granted him the opportunities to tour Australia and perform at the X-Games in Brazil. In additiotion, his innovative photography techniques have led to global exhibits of his work.Needless to say, Goetz has found a comfortable place for himself in both the music and photography worlds by expressing his explorative lifestyle through his many talents. He has the uncanny ability to captivate his audience thanks to his natural draw and eye for the extraordinary. No matter the medium, Goetz is known for entertaining colorful crowds on nearly every continent �� if not to their television sets, then through film, song, and storytelling.","['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'kba']"

I have traveled in Europe quite a bit, especially Finland (where my mom is from) and Ireland (where I was born), and also a bit to France, a country I have always loved!  (Et bien sur, je parle francais assez courramment... mais pas parfaitement.  Tambien, estudio Espanol!) - I am a pretty good cook, even though I don't have much time for cooking these days! I do enjoy eating healthy and have been learning a lot lately about raw foods and all kinds of ways you can support your health by eating various foods.- After a variety of positions in business and non-profits, including a couple years working to raise awareness about human trafficking, I work in communications at a foundation working to increase and improve the US job market and promote positive impact investing. I care a lot about corporate social responsibility and I love my job!- I LOVE reading and have so many books! I grew up without a TV and the habit of reading really stuck. :) But I also always have my latest Netflix fix... - I am a Christian and usually like to start my day with a little quiet time, reading my Bible and writing in a prayer journal. But you don't need to have my beliefs to be welcome and comfortable in my house!  I think diversity (of belief, race, orientation, nationality, whatever) is a blessing, and variety the spice of life! :)- My favorite quote, and a motto of sorts, from Maya Angelou: ""A woman in harmony with her spirit is like a river flowing.

Love traveling and the outdoors. Snowboarding is my favorite winter sport. Don't be a ski snob. I play well with others. :) ENFP for those that care. The long version of the M&B puts me in the middle of E/I, F/T, and P/J. Not sure what that means besides being very versatile in my compatibility with others. It's hard to say what I do because I wear many hats. Currently, an art director for a corporation in Soho. The bulk of my income comes from photography, retouching, video recording/editing, and sound engineering. I'm a closeted entrepreneur. Inventing stuff is a hobby. Building a 3D printer makes me a bit of a geeky nerd. I studied electrical and computer engineering and ended up graduating with an audio engineering degree. Am always eager to learn something new.Not really a novel reader, but I do read all the time. I like to read books related to the psychology of something, and DIY books. Some of my favorite magazines are Wired, Make, The Economist, The New Yorker, ID, Fast Company, and Communication Art. Definitely a news feed junkie on the subway: mostly tech, science, economy, and design topics. I don't have cable, but I do have an Apple TV and Roku box�� cable cutter for years. I have many favorite series, but here are some: Breaking Bad, True Blood, Prison Break, Broadway Empire...I'm not super picky about food. I will try most things once.

I have since returned to work but still sleeping on the couch.     I am sleeping on my couch so I can send children in Africa to high school.  The money from Airbnb is now going to fund my non profit foundation. The name of the foundation is Rose of Kenya scholarships in honor of a poor Kenyan woman named Rose Ochieng who died in November 2013 and who had dedicated herself to giving her children a good education. In Kenya it takes less than 1$US to send a child to high school for a year, yet many parents cannot meet this cost. Sending one child to secondary school for one year can cost 12 to 20 times the monthly income of parents in rural areas. In 2014 I raised money to send 13 poor children from the village of Nabuyole, in western Kenya, to high school. This year I want to send more but I cannot do that without a guarantee of funding.     I am a backpacker also.  As such,  I understand the need for budget accommodation. We all recognize that while New York is one of the most exciting and engaging destinations one can visit, it easily is one of the most expensive in terms of accommodation.

Not long after that I discovered my true passion: creating and curing spaces. In 2012 I founded my own interior design company but it didn't take long and I fell in love again.. this time with Puerto Rico. Finally I moved to the island in 2013. Together with Sylvia, I built this place called  ""The Dreamcatcher"", a childhood dream come true. A Message from Sylvia:One of the most important things that I have learned from my mother and grandmother was the importance of creating a special place for yourself, your family and friends. A home that holds beauty and memories, a space that it is alive. Have every corner tell a story and decorate it with little reminders of where you come from. Make it a home that provides a sanctuary for the special people in your life. The first time I had my own place I realized how important it was for me to create a little oasis. I still have books, drapes and furniture from my small house in Sarasota, where I went to school at the time. I must have had 25 more places after that and each one of them was like an empty canvas to rearrange my memories with objects I had collected over time. After 15 years away, life looped me back home to Puerto Rico. I reconnected with the wisdom and love of my grandmother and not to forget all her simple yet beautiful vintage furniture, which now serve as comfort and decoration at the Dreamcatcher.This is our home, and while you are here, yours as well����Sylvia","['email', 'phone', 'amex', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'kba']"

'Baidu' was inspired by a poem written more than 800 years ago during the Song Dynasty. The poem compares the search for a retreating beauty amid chaotic glamour with the search for one's dream while confronted by life's many obstacles. '...hundreds and thousands of times, for her I searched in chaos, suddenly, I turned by chance, to where the lights were waning, and there she stood.'Baidu, whose literal meaning is hundreds of times, represents persistent search for the ideal."" ����Robin Li","['email', 'phone', 'reviews']"

I have an extensive collection of several hundred art books ranging in subject from painting, photography, jewelry, fashion, music, film, architecture, interior design. Everything is organized by subject. Aside from art books, I have hundreds of books related to my oother interests organized by topic: biographies, books on film, books on philosophy, books on psychology, books on anthropology with a focus on shamanism, books on sociology, a section of fiction books ranging from Faulkner to Dostoevsky, and of course a collection of auction catalogues primarily contemporary art, magnificent jewelry, and special sales i.e. the property of Doris Duke, the property of Jackie Kennedy.The books are ALOT OF FUN! Enjoy them but please put them back where you got them off the shelves, and also be delicate with the art books as they are expensive.My style of traveling is often last minute, and for extended periods 3 weeks or more. I do a lot of my screenwriting while I travel. Sometimes I just get so over the city that I need a break, so I take off. My hosting style is to be as accommodating and available as possible. I treat you as if you were a friend coming to stay. I just ask the same of guests as I ask of my friends: please be respectful of my belongings and of my privacy. Throughout the home there is expensive furniture, rugs, art, books, even the wine glasses. It's not a museum, I live with these things in my normal life and they are meant for use. I trust my guests not to damage anything intentionally.   Hey accidents happen though - if you stain a towel, tell me. If you do break a crystal wine glass from Riedel, and when you break it red wine spills on the $10,000 Tibetan rug please let me know. Certain things in the apartment like the rugs have to be cleaned in a special way and I wouldn't want you to make it worse. It's not going to be a big deal, accidents happen and we can work through it, just be honest. Rugs can be cleaned and wine glasses can be replaced. Just please let me know ahead of time and I won't be surprised and upset.If I am traveling while you are staying in my place, I will have a local manager for the property to show you around when you arrive, and be on call to help if there is a problem. I love my home, and I want you to love it and be as comfortable there as I am.Also since my super is useless I don't use him�� Instead I found an ace local handyman named Ray, he's a great guy whose number I will leave.

We are avid soccer (football) fans and have season tickets for NYCFC. Emi will always cheer for NOB (Messi's home club!). We both love to travel and after having taken trips to Mexico, Argentina, Iceland, and a handful upstate getaways together, we look forward to exploring Europe this summer (while sprinkling in a few weddings as well). We saw every single Oscar nominated film for best picture this year and we love to get out to see live music and just enjoy the city as well. We have a ton of favorite restaurants (mostly in the neighborhood - happy to provide recommendations!) and I think one or the other of us eats Pho about once a week (it's that good). We both also love to cook and you'll find many different flavors floating around the kitchen.As hosts, we're new at this! But, we've had friends and family stay with us in the past and I think you'll find we'll stay out of your hair, but are happy to help if you need directions or a nice bar for a quick drink. You will have everything you need when you stay with us and you're welcome to make recommendations if there is something you think we may be missing!As guests, we like to treat someone else's home as we do our own! We've both put a lot of time and energy into creating a warm, comfy environment and we can only imagine our hosts have done the same....and would like to keep it that way! You will likely barely notice we've been there - we like to leave things the way we found them =)Ultimately, we like to treat others and their space with respect. We hope we'll find the same in our guests and hosts in the future!","['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'work_email']"

We both work in banking and financial services in Manhattan and it's a very demanding lifestyle.  Traveling allows us to get away from stresses of daily life and learn a lot about the world.We travel very often, and as a result we are able to offer our Manhattan apartment for short-term rentals and host guests.  Because we also use the apartment ourselves when not hosting, it allows us to create a very welcoming environment for our guests and anticipate their needs.  You can read more about our property in the Listing Description.When traveling, we always try to explore new and sometimes exotic places.  We try to take short vacations 4-5 times a year, not including frequent visits to our Florida beach apartment.  Western Europe is one of our favorite destinations and we always try to visit as many countries and cities as we can in one visit.  Lately we have also been into visiting Asia, such as Japan and Thailand, and we are in love with the culture, architecture and food.  When not traveling or working, we enjoy taking care of our two beautiful cats, driving down to the beach or engaging in a water-related activity, such as boating, jet skiing or simply relaxing at the pool or hot tub.  Our hobbies include working out, ballroom dancing, having people over for a themed party or a BBQ, and trying various cuisines both at restaurants and at home.  We are also animal lovers and support local shelters and charities that take care of abandoned pets and wildlife.","['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba']"
