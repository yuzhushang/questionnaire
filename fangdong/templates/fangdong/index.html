            I love life and appreciate all that has come my way.  Every day is a blessing though I never have enough hours in the day to do all I have to do or want to do. While I am not in NYC, where I left an excellent freelance graphic design career working with Conde Nast Publications lastly at Vanity Fair,  my husband and I maintain a private reserve in Costa Rica where we cherish and protect acres of primary and secondary rainforest. My favorite book  is "The Unvanquished" by William Faulkner, which I read in Costa Rica, while pregnant with my son, where we were living on our reserve in a tin shack without electricity. A total Bliss! I love my gem in Williamsburg. I am involved and have sponsored many cultural events in the neighborhood. I love to ride horses! I deliver calves, raise chickens, tilapia, dogs, cows, and a beautiful son. I fix roads, love to cook, tutor, love modern dance, abstract art,  walking over the Williamsburg Bridge to Manhattan which I do almost every day, and music of many types. Mother, wife...  go fishing? You bet.
